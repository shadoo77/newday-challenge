----------------------------------------------
I made a simulate login user interface with select html tag because we don't have here a database , i made something like locale storage to login to home page , also made a logout button to log out of the page.

It's also a dynamic so that you can add many extra item stock in itemsStock.json file in data folder, all users are in users.json instead of database .
I have also made some changes in Bootstrap within scss file to modify breakpoints.
